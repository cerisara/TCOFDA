QO and you then your good resolution
RO oh well I # 's it going to be hard eh quit
QY you
Y well yeah
QY you quit smoking
D as if you'll succeed
I not frankly expect you saw ah now it is five euros package uh increasingly frankly I even see the interest there is more then we don 'will not even be allowed to smoke in the box or in the bars the stuff if you can even smoke with friends I do not see the interest which
A yeah if
I yeah but you must think of others what you expect when incurred tobacco
D say
I you are going knowing full well that there will be somebody who smokes so
A here
I yeah but uh it's a uh majority is obliged to comply with a minority still what
D you speak
B TSS
QY it's bullshit frankly when you go boxed or in a bar you going to tell me that the smoke that bothers you
N in a bar uh box not because that inevitably # er after a while you uh t 'do what it
I and # then the limit I say not good OK it may bother but in cases to standards such as requiring putting you know the smoke vacuums that retirement and own rejects what it I will tell you it's it's not super hard to set up #
A but no
D yeah but expect it to be cheap though
I instead they repression on all that has become a minority but hey they do have rights smokers sorry although I obviously understand that good in # as # non smoker it's sure it m 'suits # a bit but uh yeah the bars of the boxes # # night will lose a lot of revenue and think what a # little to tobacconists
D it's not that expensive
A yeah
B hum
B hum hum yeah
I especially at- ~ tobacco uh coffee tobacco then they will sell the pack of cigarettes and the guys they will not have the right to smoke-uh in the stuff there you'll still tell me that it's stupid
A Yes
I not frankly I think about it they abuse a # little what and yes as I say stuff all the restaurants that anyway I was not before
B hum
I ben restaurant since you are eating
B hum
A yeah
I but whether in box # of # m night it has never bothered
B Well
I it's true that you are going so often
A yeah
I every night every night
I but not me I do not mind when I 'am there but when you get out you stink frankly the cigarette that is what unpleasant
QY you wash your hair
Y ben better why the Jackal
Y yes yes it's safe
I in the background if it gets people to stop smoking kind of proof you see me because of that I have stopped eh
A yeah yeah it's clear
I So uh, but I'm not sure if that is the primary purpose
I they not increase taxes to stop smoking they increase taxes to earn a little more money # eh
A it's clear
I it's not good again in # # same time
I but yeah I see the side tobacconist uh I not give him finally I gave him more than two years with me all the stuff that they have uh
I yeah ben # # same time
I Now you have to be a pigeon now to open a tobacco shop
B hum
B finally
I So much for good intentions
B hum
I that's not bad
A yes must be successfully s' stick to it
I it will be hard especially for
I the resolutions are made to be exempted
D oh so I think I will succeed
I yeah we'll see should not be too hard
I I think not ben I have already started to slow down a bit you see #
I I smoke more than two packs a day I 'in smoke more that one
QY you smoked two packs
Y yeah
B the cow
I Ben finally when I was with my friends what
B I eh #
